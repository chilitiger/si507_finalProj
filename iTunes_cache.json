She was like a breath of fresh air the first time he saw her on the busy streets, sitting regally in a Tonga. He would follow her everyday to the bazaar, back to her house till one day he mustered the courage to speak to her and tell her his true feelings - his 13 year-old heart, smitten by her simplicity. She, of course, didn\u2019t take him seriously and brushed him off. Time passed by and Zoya moved to Delhi to study further.Love they say is a feeling that only grows stronger with time and Kundan\u2019s love for Zoya never diminished, he carried his feeling all through college and his heart flipped when Zoya came back to his town. With Zoya back in Benaras, Kundan\u2019s world was filled with excitement as he was thinking of finally telling her how he felt. Zoya finally met Kundan and confessed her true feelings to him.

The team is a rag-tag bunch of girls with their own agenda. A bunch of girls who have forgotten what it is like to play for the love of the game. Of playing because you want glory for your country. Not because you want a pensioned job or a government flat. They have all forgotten the sharp thrill of just holding the hockey stick, keeping their eyes on the ball and playing for all they are worth. They have played every game but hockey to make sure they get selected every year in the Indian National team. But what does it really mean to play for the Indian National team? To play for India? The girls have never known the thrilling energy of being Team India. Of giving their all to see their country's name on a trophy. But Kabir Khan, once a captain, now forgotten, does. He knows what it takes to get there. And what it means to return empty handed. This time, he wants to make sure that it's different. He knows there are no second chances. Despite his past, he believes that if only the girls played as one, anything would be possible. Because Kabir Khan believes that it is not that we can't win. It's just that we have never believed we can. CHAK DE INDIA is the story of a coach's fight of making his team, Team India by overcoming their diverse backgrounds, by learning to use everything that life hurls on them as a secret weapon. It's a story about honesty, sincerity and integrity.

A team that exists more on paper and less in reality.The team is a rag-tag bunch of girls with their own agenda. A bunch of girls who have forgotten what it is like to play for the love of the game. Of playing because you want glory for your country. Not because you want a pensioned job or a government flat. They have all forgotten the sharp thrill of just holding the hockey stick, keeping their eyes on the ball, and playing for all they are worth. They have played every game but hockey to make sure they get selected every year in the Indian National team. But what does it really mean to play for the Indian National team? To play for India?The girls have never known the thrilling energy of being Team India. Of giving their all to see their country's name on a trophy. But Kabir Khan, once a captain, now forgotten, does. He knows what it takes to get there. And what it means to return empty-handed. This time, he wants to make sure that it's different. He knows there are no second chances. Despite his past, he believes that if only the girls played as one, anything would be possible.Because Kabir Khan believes that it is not that we can't win. It's just that we have never believed we can.CHAK DE INDIA is the story of a coach's fight of making his team, Team India by overcoming their diverse backgrounds, by learning to use everything that life hurls on them as a secret weapon. It's a story about honesty, sincerity, and integrity. The film became a cult classic and won its leading man the National Award and put the Indian National Sport \u201cHockey\u201d, back on the map."}]}, " https://itunes.apple.com/search_attribute_genreterm_entity_movie_media_movie_term_avatar": {"resultCount": 15, "results": [{"wrapperType": "track", "kind": "feature-movie", "trackId": 354112018, "artistName": "James Cameron", "trackName": "Avatar (2009)", "trackCensoredName": "Avatar (2009)", "trackViewUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/avatar-2009/id354112018?uo=4", "previewUrl": "https://video-ssl.itunes.apple.com/itunes-assets/Video123/v4/4e/e0/8f/4ee08ffa-5a8c-cd6a-4211-cbf2d4756d8c/mzvf_9313135483986778586.640x354.h264lc.U.p.m4v", "artworkUrl30": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video/v4/3a/e6/70/3ae670e1-3dc4-43d7-2e31-dea480f710c3/pr_source.lsr/30x30bb.jpg", "artworkUrl60": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video/v4/3a/e6/70/3ae670e1-3dc4-43d7-2e31-dea480f710c3/pr_source.lsr/60x60bb.jpg", "artworkUrl100": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video/v4/3a/e6/70/3ae670e1-3dc4-43d7-2e31-dea480f710c3/pr_source.lsr/100x100bb.jpg", "collectionPrice": 14.99, "trackPrice": 14.99, "trackRentalPrice": 3.99, "collectionHdPrice": 14.99, "trackHdPrice": 14.99, "trackHdRentalPrice": 3.99, "releaseDate": "2009-12-18T08:00:00Z", "collectionExplicitness": "notExplicit", "trackExplicitness": "notExplicit", "trackTimeMillis": 9702367, "country": "USA", "currency": "USD", "primaryGenreName": "Action & Adventure", "contentAdvisoryRating": "PG-13", "longDescription": "From Academy Award\u00ae-winning director James Cameron comes Avatar, the story of an ex-Marine who finds himself thrust into hostilities on an alien planet filled with exotic life forms.

The Spirit tracks this cold-hearted killer from Central City\u2019s rundown warehouses, to the damp catacombs, to the windswept waterfront ... all the while facing a bevy of beautiful women who either want to seduce, love or kill our masked crusader. Surrounding him at every turn are Ellen Dolan (Sarah Paulson), the whip-smart girl-next-door; Silken Floss (Scarlett Johansson), a punk secretary and frigid vixen; Plaster of Paris (Paz Vega), a murderous French nightclub dancer; Lorelei (Jaime King), a phantom siren; and Morgenstern (Stana Katic), a sexy young cop. In the vein of Batman Begins and Sin City, The Spirit takes us on a sinister, gut-wrenching ride with a hero who is born, murdered and born again. \"The Spirit,\" which opens Christmas Day, stars Gabriel Macht, Eva Mendes, Sarah Paulson, Dan Lauria, Paz Vega and Jaime King, with Scarlett Johansson and Samuel L. Jackson as \"The Octopus.\" Odd Lot Entertainment and Lionsgate are production partners on the film which is written for the screen and directed by Frank Miller and based on the comic book series created by Will Eisner.

South Africa\u2019s record-breaking novel is a coming-of-age comedy following a young boy through his year at a private boarding school, and set against the backdrop of a country coming of age. Starring: John Cleese, Troye Sivan, Jeremy Crutchley, Jason Cope, Tanit Phoenix, Charlbi Dean, Julie Summers, Aaron McIlroy. Director: Donovan Marsh. Producers: Ross Garland & Brad Logan. The Story - It\u2019s South Africa 1990. Two major events are about to happen: The release of Nelson Mandela and, more importantly, it\u2019s Spud Milton\u2019s first year at an elite boys only private boarding school. John Milton is a boy from an ordinary background who wins a scholarship to a private school in Kwazulu-Natal, South Africa. Surrounded by boys with nicknames like Gecko, Rambo, Rain Man and Mad Dog, Spud has his hands full trying to adapt to his new home. Along the way Spud takes his first tentative steps along the path to manhood. (The path it seems could be a rather long road). Armed with only his wits and his diary, Spud takes us from illegal night swimming to the red-hot furnace of the cricket pitch, from ghost busting to a catastrophic family vacation. He also invites us into the mind of a boy struggling to come to terms with a strange new world, a boy whose eyes are being opened to love, friendship and complete insanity. Spud the book - Spud won the Booksellers\u2019 Choice award 2006, and continues to break SA fiction publishing records. The book was launched internationally in 2007. A Barnes & Noble top 10 hard cover youth title in the USA in 2007, it won a US national teen book award in June 2008. It has subsequently been published in the UK, Commonwealth, Italy, Brazil, Russia and India. John van de Ruit continued his record-breaking writing with the sequel Spud \u2013 The Madness Continues, which was published in 2007, and released in the US at the end of 2008. The third installment in the series, Spud \u2013 Learning to Fly, was published in 2009, and sold 65, 000 copies in SA in the first two weeks from the launch date. The fourth and final book in the series, Spud \u2013 Exit Pursued by a Bear, launched in 2012. Finding Spud - With a thirteen year-old boy as the main character in the film, the search for a young actor to play the lead role was critical. A global search started in early 2009. But it was good fortune that led to the discovery of Troye Sivan. Producer Ross Garland\u2019s uncle in Australia sent him a newspaper clipping of a boy from Perth who had just starred in Hollywood blockbuster \u201cX-men Origins: Wolverine\u201d. The article also said he was born in Johannesburg and a well-known singing sensation. Ross tracked down his agent in Los Angeles, and Troye sent his audition in from Australia. After a search all over South Africa, he came out streaks ahead as the perfect boy to play John \u201cSpud\u201d Milton. Finding the Guv - Top international casting agency Hubbard Casting was recruited to find a British star to play \u201cthe Guv\u201d. After initially hearing that John Cleese didn\u2019t do this type of smaller, independent film, the screenplay was sent to him on a wing and a prayer. The call came back that he liked the script, and wanted to sign on to the project. With a performance that is both comical and moving, it\u2019s new ground for John Cleese. Nobody can think who would have been more perfect for the part."}, {"wrapperType": "track", "kind": "feature-movie", "collectionId": 1531970848, "trackId": 1520322472, "artistName": "Patrick Lussier", "collectionName": "The Prophecy 4-Movie Collection", "trackName": "The Prophecy 3: The Ascent", "collectionCensoredName": "The Prophecy 4-Movie Collection", "trackCensoredName": "The Prophecy 3: The Ascent", "collectionArtistId": 1008915738, "collectionArtistViewUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/paramount-home-entertainment-inc/1008915738?uo=4", "collectionViewUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-prophecy-3-the-ascent/id1520322472?uo=4", "trackViewUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-prophecy-3-the-ascent/id1520322472?uo=4", "previewUrl": "https://video-ssl.itunes.apple.com/itunes-assets/Video113/v4/ee/56/74/ee5674be-c587-ef0a-ad23-bcff99313181/mzvf_11005514306793207319.640x480.h264lc.U.p.m4v", "artworkUrl30": "https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video123/v4/d6/43/01/d6430183-d298-90d1-6402-7f83b6c710b1/mzi.ueelyygj.jpg/30x30bb.jpg", "artworkUrl60": "https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video123/v4/d6/43/01/d6430183-d298-90d1-6402-7f83b6c710b1/mzi.ueelyygj.jpg/60x60bb.jpg", "artworkUrl100": "https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video123/v4/d6/43/01/d6430183-d298-90d1-6402-7f83b6c710b1/mzi.ueelyygj.jpg/100x100bb.jpg", "collectionPrice": 9.99, "trackPrice": 9.99, "trackRentalPrice": 3.99, "collectionHdPrice": 12.99, "trackHdPrice": 12.99, "trackHdRentalPrice": 3.99, "releaseDate": "2000-03-14T08:00:00Z", "collectionExplicitness": "notExplicit", "trackExplicitness": "notExplicit", "discCount": 1, "discNumber": 1, "trackCount": 4, "trackNumber": 2, "trackTimeMillis": 5037920, "country": "USA", "currency": "USD", "primaryGenreName": "Thriller", "contentAdvisoryRating": "R", "shortDescription": "Christopher Walken (Suicide Kings, The Prophecy) and Vincent Spano (The Tie That Binds) star in The", "longDescription": "Christopher Walken (Suicide Kings, The Prophecy) and Vincent Spano (The Tie That Binds) star in The Ascent, the third thrilling installment of the action-packed Prophecy trilogy!

He then decides to set out on a fairly new frontier, \u201cfree surfing\u201d getting paid to simply go out and get photo\u2019s, something that had not been done up until then. \u00a0In his early 20\u2019s, his name became synonymous with the legendary surf spot known as \u201cOff The Wall\u201d all the while riding shorter boards in bigger surf something that most had never done or dreamed of doing. Archy\u2019s Ariel attack in the water and explosive surfing revolutionized what we view as high performance surfing today. \u201cARCHY\u201d is a timeless film that tells the story of 3 very different generations in surfing. Spanning the 80\u2019s, 90\u2019s, 2000 and on, Archy\u2019s amazing story is one of survival thru surf stardom at an early age, fame, drugs, alcohol, sponsorships\u00a0and the surf rock star lifestyle. Light will finally be shed on the true-life story of one of the most charismatic and legendary surfers in history. This is a story that needs to be told."}, {"wrapperType": "track", "kind": "feature-movie", "trackId": 1520425216, "artistName": "Robert Manganelli", "trackName": "After Image", "trackCensoredName": "After Image", "trackViewUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/after-image/id1520425216?uo=4", "previewUrl": "https://video-ssl.itunes.apple.com/itunes-assets/Video123/v4/72/bc/6f/72bc6ff2-18fa-3415-7926-d0fb4d921731/mzvf_7912642166002971.640x478.h264lc.U.p.m4v", "artworkUrl30": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video123/v4/a4/74/1b/a4741b2d-7a0f-100a-c22a-fecd654eea33/2490055208506.jpg/30x30bb.jpg", "artworkUrl60": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video123/v4/a4/74/1b/a4741b2d-7a0f-100a-c22a-fecd654eea33/2490055208506.jpg/60x60bb.jpg", "artworkUrl100": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video123/v4/a4/74/1b/a4741b2d-7a0f-100a-c22a-fecd654eea33/2490055208506.jpg/100x100bb.jpg", "collectionPrice": 12.99, "trackPrice": 12.99, "trackRentalPrice": 3.99, "collectionHdPrice": 14.99, "trackHdPrice": 14.99, "trackHdRentalPrice": 3.99, "releaseDate": "2005-08-02T07:00:00Z", "collectionExplicitness": "notExplicit", "trackExplicitness": "notExplicit", "trackTimeMillis": 5528993, "country": "USA", "currency": "USD", "primaryGenreName": "Drama", "contentAdvisoryRating": "R", "shortDescription": "Grammy winner John Mellencamp (Falling From Grace) stars with Academy Award\u00ae winner Louise Fletcher", "longDescription": "Grammy winner John Mellencamp (Falling From Grace) stars with Academy Award\u00ae winner Louise Fletcher (One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, Best Actress, 1975; Cruel Intentions) in an intense, psychological crime story that delivers thrills in the must-see tradition of Insomnia and One Hour Photo!

The 67-year-old owner, Georges Perrier, nearly as iconic as his landmark eatery, is preparing to sell the restaurant after more than four decades in business. Filmmaker Erika Frankel, a native of the Philly suburbs, asks if she could film Perrier as an era-ending tribute. Perrier, however, has other plans. He decides to withdraw the sale and reinvent Le Bec-Fin by hiring a new prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Chef Nicholas Elmi, who achieved national fame on the \"Top Chef\" TV show. Perrier wants to pass the business to Elmi, but finds he has trouble letting go of the spatula. Over a three-year period, Frankel captures this mercurial, passionate, quixotic force of nature as he struggles to preserve his sumptuous Gallic dishes in an era where casual attitudes and lighter fare are taking hold. Spiced with archival footage and interviews from world-renowned chefs, such as Thomas Keller, Daniel Boulud, and Eric Ripert, King Georges is a feast for the eyes, as well as a touching portrait of a master artist in the twilight of his career who realizes he is still hungry for seconds."}, {"wrapperType": "track", "kind": "feature-movie", "trackId": 1516359714, "artistName": "Jayson Thiessen", "trackName": "My Little Pony: Equestria Girls", "trackCensoredName": "My Little Pony: Equestria Girls", "trackViewUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/my-little-pony-equestria-girls/id1516359714?uo=4", "previewUrl": "https://video-ssl.itunes.apple.com/itunes-assets/Video123/v4/c6/f1/73/c6f17364-77b0-e7dc-1ed1-721cfc958680/mzvf_8614622954722076890.640x476.h264lc.U.p.m4v", "artworkUrl30": "https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video123/v4/dc/19/09/dc1909b4-465c-6ad0-b35b-98c6e0adee74/mza_6998450850933721001.jpg/30x30bb.jpg", "artworkUrl60": "https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video123/v4/dc/19/09/dc1909b4-465c-6ad0-b35b-98c6e0adee74/mza_6998450850933721001.jpg/60x60bb.jpg", "artworkUrl100": "https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video123/v4/dc/19/09/dc1909b4-465c-6ad0-b35b-98c6e0adee74/mza_6998450850933721001.jpg/100x100bb.jpg", "collectionPrice": 8.99, "trackPrice": 8.99, "trackRentalPrice": 3.99, "collectionHdPrice": 9.99, "trackHdPrice": 9.99, "trackHdRentalPrice": 3.99, "releaseDate": "2013-06-15T07:00:00Z", "collectionExplicitness": "notExplicit", "trackExplicitness": "notExplicit", "trackTimeMillis": 4394560, "country": "USA", "currency": "USD", "primaryGenreName": "Kids & Family", "contentAdvisoryRating": "NR", "shortDescription": "When her crown is stolen from the Crystal Empire, Twilight Sparkle pursues the thief, Sunset Shimmer", "longDescription": "When her crown is stolen from the Crystal Empire, Twilight Sparkle pursues the thief, Sunset Shimmer, into an alternate world where she finds herself turned into\u2026a teenage girl!

It was a band that instantly captured the imagination and acclaim of critics, journalists, artists, celebrities, producers and DJs, but one that struggled to sell many records or to trouble the charts. However, it was a band that ultimately found huge favour from a rock audience who came to love the group with an uncommon fervour. The group was of course called Little Feat. At the centre of the Little Feat story is Lowell George, the group's frontman and principal songwriter. Over the course of a decade leading the Feat, he wove a unique tapestry using a singular artistic vision which ended, shockingly, with his untimely death in 1979. Lowell Gorge however left an ever astonishing body of work which still today, almost 40 years on, is as relevant and popular as it has ever been. This film, the first ever to chronicle George's life, music and career, uses archive footage and interviews of and with Lowell and Little Feat, plus contributions from many of those who knew him best, to visually recount the sometimes ecstatic, other times tragic life and times of this maverick genius."}, {"wrapperType": "track", "kind": "feature-movie", "trackId": 1171596399, "artistName": "Chrome Dreams", "trackName": "Prince - Slave Trade", "trackCensoredName": "Prince - Slave Trade", "trackViewUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/prince-slave-trade/id1171596399?uo=4", "previewUrl": "https://video-ssl.itunes.apple.com/itunes-assets/Video114/v4/34/ef/43/34ef4301-d1e2-8401-0c4d-1285ba39b6bd/mzvf_4380399174209227978.640x472.h264lc.U.p.m4v", "artworkUrl30": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video52/v4/5c/7e/ea/5c7eea1f-8cf5-6fb3-dfe5-2b831838989c/SlaveTrade_iTunes_Poster.jpg/30x30bb.jpg", "artworkUrl60": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video52/v4/5c/7e/ea/5c7eea1f-8cf5-6fb3-dfe5-2b831838989c/SlaveTrade_iTunes_Poster.jpg/60x60bb.jpg", "artworkUrl100": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video52/v4/5c/7e/ea/5c7eea1f-8cf5-6fb3-dfe5-2b831838989c/SlaveTrade_iTunes_Poster.jpg/100x100bb.jpg", "collectionPrice": 12.99, "trackPrice": 12.99, "trackRentalPrice": 3.99, "releaseDate": "2016-11-04T07:00:00Z", "collectionExplicitness": "notExplicit", "trackExplicitness": "notExplicit", "trackTimeMillis": 9021020, "country": "USA", "currency": "USD", "primaryGenreName": "Music Documentaries", "contentAdvisoryRating": "Unrated", "shortDescription": "In the mid-1990s reports emerged that Prince had fallen into dispute with his record company.

Having signed what was ostensibly a new, 100 million dollar contract just a couple of years before, Prince was now demanding - not unreasonably to most commentators - control of his masters and the freedom to release what he wanted when he wanted. After a bitter war of words, during which the star scrawled Slave across his cheek whenever he appeared in public and routinely dissed his label, the parties finally settled and Prince henceforth was free to take full control of his music and the way it was sold to consumers. Prince approached this task with devastating foresight as he routinely created new marketing concepts which, with time, became the norm across the music world. Recognizing the future power of the world-wide-web as an essential distribution tool for recorded work long before the majors realized what a huge threat the internet would pose to their core sales methods, it is no exaggeration to say that Prince reinvented the industry for the 21st century. This film explores and documents this strange but prophetic period in Prince's career and with the help of those who witnessed events as they unfolded, shows that Prince is not just a remarkable musician, performer and composer, but arguably, also has the shrewdest brain in show business."}, {"wrapperType": "track", "kind": "feature-movie", "trackId": 1231264239, "artistName": "Tom O'Dell", "trackName": "Going Underground: McCartney, The Beatles and the UK Counter-culture", "trackCensoredName": "Going Underground: McCartney, The Beatles and the UK Counter-culture", "trackViewUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/going-underground-mccartney-the-beatles-and-the/id1231264239?uo=4", "previewUrl": "https://video-ssl.itunes.apple.com/itunes-assets/Video113/v4/62/c4/cf/62c4cfb5-0a58-d7be-2d77-9f8df62b8934/mzvf_13573667154603150597.640x480.h264lc.U.p.m4v", "artworkUrl30": "https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video52/v4/ed/17/0a/ed170ad7-91de-87a6-82d3-d476be786a29/GoingUnderground_iTunes_Poster.jpg/30x30bb.jpg", "artworkUrl60": "https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video52/v4/ed/17/0a/ed170ad7-91de-87a6-82d3-d476be786a29/GoingUnderground_iTunes_Poster.jpg/60x60bb.jpg", "artworkUrl100": "https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video52/v4/ed/17/0a/ed170ad7-91de-87a6-82d3-d476be786a29/GoingUnderground_iTunes_Poster.jpg/100x100bb.jpg", "collectionPrice": 12.99, "trackPrice": 12.99, "trackRentalPrice": 3.99, "releaseDate": "2017-03-21T07:00:00Z", "collectionExplicitness": "notExplicit", "trackExplicitness": "notExplicit", "trackTimeMillis": 9170440, "country": "USA", "currency": "USD", "primaryGenreName": "Music Documentaries", "contentAdvisoryRating": "NR", "shortDescription": "In the mid-1960s the often rigid and colourless British way of life was irrevocably transformed by", "longDescription": "In the mid-1960s the often rigid and colourless British way of life was irrevocably transformed by the emergence of a cultural underground movement. Led by a loose collective of young radicals, they introduced new social, sexual and aesthetic perspectives. Operating out of the heart of London, their various activities, from 'The International Times' - a bi-weekly journal that no hipster could be seen without - to the psychedelic nightclub UFO, promoted alternative lifestyles and values, and sparked a social revolution. This film not only traces the history of this underground scene, but also explores its impact on the pre-eminent British group of the era, The Beatles. Although they were well established by the time the movement emerged, Paul McCartney in particular, was closely linked with several of its key players, and through his exposure to cutting edge concepts brought ideas directly from the avant-garde into the mainstream.

Hopkins (Viggo Mortensen) was a cowboy and dispatch rider for the us cavalry who had once been billed as the greatest rider the west had ever known.

This reunion serves as a catalyst to explore the band\u2019s roots and the difficulties they faced growing up. Home movies, childhood photos and revealing interviews with family members -- including a colorful group of parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins -- expose how the influence of their family has informed the creativity that drives Kings of Leon today.

The band\u2019s achievements have rippled back home to affect their family, who take great pride in, and some of the credit for, the cousins who made it big. The story of Kings of Leon has been called the \"best band creation story in recent memory\" and, for the first time, is being shared by the people who lived it."}, {"wrapperType": "track", "kind": "feature-movie", "trackId": 296609302, "artistName": "Tom De Cerchio", "trackName": "Celtic Pride", "trackCensoredName": "Celtic Pride", "trackViewUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/celtic-pride/id296609302?uo=4", "previewUrl": "https://video-ssl.itunes.apple.com/itunes-assets/Video118/v4/fd/c2/8b/fdc28b15-3b76-22b2-850f-fe9a73ecd007/mzvf_5737970631215481176.640x460.h264lc.U.p.m4v", "artworkUrl30": "https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video/51/32/3d/mzi.qzqnoftv.jpg/30x30bb.jpg", "artworkUrl60": "https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video/51/32/3d/mzi.qzqnoftv.jpg/60x60bb.jpg", "artworkUrl100": "https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video/51/32/3d/mzi.qzqnoftv.jpg/100x100bb.jpg", "collectionPrice": 9.99, "trackPrice": 9.99, "trackRentalPrice": 3.99, "collectionHdPrice": 17.99, "trackHdPrice": 17.99, "trackHdRentalPrice": 3.99, "releaseDate": "1996-04-19T07:00:00Z", "collectionExplicitness": "notExplicit", "trackExplicitness": "notExplicit", "trackTimeMillis": 5435743, "country": "USA", "currency": "USD", "primaryGenreName": "Comedy", "contentAdvisoryRating": "PG-13", "longDescription": "Mike and Jimmy, two die-hard sports fans who will risk anything for the Celtics to win, are really getting into the games.

A surprising number of Americans make their living off a vast river of trash. Dogtown Redemption follows this river and its inhabitants in a lively, bustling yet invisible corner of California. Every year, Californians buy about 22 billion carbonated and non-carbonated drinks in aluminum, glass, and plastic containers\u2014a river of trash. Under California law beverage containers can be redeemed for a few cents per container. As a result of this legal innovation, trash can be turned into cash--a lifeline for a subculture of marginalized recyclers: the unemployed and underemployed, the elderly, the mentally and physically disabled, former criminals, drug addicts and prostitutes can reclaim the pride and joy that comes with having a job.  We follow the lives of three recyclers: Jason Witt, the titan of recycling; Landon Goodwin, a former minister and addict who struggles with his own fall from grace; and Miss Hayok Kay, the ultimate outsider, formerly a Polkacide drummer from a prominent Korean-American family, now at the mercy of the elements and predators. Through them, we are introduced to the art, science, economics and politics of recycling: what it offers, how it touches the poor and why it matters to all of us. We follow their lives through the prism of a single recycling center: Alliance Metals, located in West Oakland. With annual sales in the millions, Alliance is an anomaly in an otherwise depressed neighborhood that has witnessed the steady flight, erosion and collapse of American industry. Its owner, Jay Anast, purchases bottles and cans from shopping cart recyclers. His business operates as a financial hub and community center, turning Alliance not only into a center of economic activity but a Fellini set populated with the most improbable of characters\u2014the pirates of trash. By virtually any measure, the denizens of the recycling center\u2014the poorest of the poor\u2014should be dead. But they defy Darwin. Poverty has turned them into the masters of improvisation and ingenuity.  In the view of the residents of Magnolia Row and other new developments in West Oakland, Jay\u2019s time is up. His business is noisy, smelly, ugly and dirty\u2014a giant garbage can. It attracts blight: scavengers, drug dealers, and criminals who depress, destroy and disrespect the promise of the American dream. The rattle of the shopping carts, missing garbage cans, litter on the streets, public defecation, theft, crime and trespassing are offered as evidence that the recyclers are not only stealing garbage but are a blight upon the neighborhood.  Dogged by addiction, mental health issues, homelessness and poverty, the recyclers' grip on life remains tenuous. Recycling serves as the only constant in their life. Yet with commodity prices collapsing, the neighbors calling for a ban on shopping cart traffic, and the city launching a sting against Alliance Metals, their way of life is threatened from all sides. As the battle for the future of the recycling center heats up, a larger debate over the history, culture and future of West Oakland grows more intense.  The question of who owns our garbage makes these otherwise marginal characters important voices in a conflict over race, class and space in a modern American city. And that war is not only one waged on the streets, but also at City Hall\u2014a battle over who defines the rules that equate poverty and recycling with blight, crime and theft."}]}, " https://itunes.apple.com/search_attribute_genreterm_entity_movie_media_movie_term_remember me": {"resultCount": 13, "results": [{"wrapperType": "track", "kind": "feature-movie", "trackId": 368682111, "artistName": "Allen Coulter", "trackName": "Remember Me (2010)", "trackCensoredName": "Remember Me (2010)", "trackViewUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/remember-me-2010/id368682111?uo=4", "previewUrl": "https://video-ssl.itunes.apple.com/itunes-assets/Video128/v4/6d/da/57/6dda57c6-5dc8-7fe8-ef06-3fdf0a142969/mzvf_1435209417638043620.640x460.h264lc.U.p.m4v", "artworkUrl30": "https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video/99/aa/d7/mzi.xszbrokd.jpg/30x30bb.jpg", "artworkUrl60": "https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video/99/aa/d7/mzi.xszbrokd.jpg/60x60bb.jpg", "artworkUrl100": "https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video/99/aa/d7/mzi.xszbrokd.jpg/100x100bb.jpg", "collectionPrice": 5.99, "trackPrice": 5.99, "trackRentalPrice": 3.99, "collectionHdPrice": 7.99, "trackHdPrice": 7.99, "trackHdRentalPrice": 3.99, "releaseDate": "2010-03-12T08:00:00Z", "collectionExplicitness": "notExplicit", "trackExplicitness": "notExplicit", "trackTimeMillis": 6740767, "country": "USA", "currency": "USD", "primaryGenreName": "Romance", "contentAdvisoryRating": "PG-13", "longDescription": "In the summer of 2001, New York college student Tyler (Robert Pattinson, The Twilight Saga) is still feeling lost from the tragedy that has strained his relationship with his father when he meets Ally (Emilie de Ravin, TV\u2019s \u201cLost\u201d), a girl who understands his pain.

They explore the craft of song writing and the people, events and influences that dictate that. WE WROTE THIS YESTERDAY showcases the band at their most open and collaborative as they relish the excitement of playing to crowds in new cities who\u2019ve never seen them before. Along the way they set a fresh challenge for themselves; taking their collaborative culture one step further as they attempt to write and record a mini album in just 2 days, with the other musicians on tour. The filming of this process not only lifts the lid on the art of song writing in an unforced and natural way but captures the journey and story as a group of artists collide, bringing references, ideas and musical styles from Senegal, Sweden, Malawi, Cape Town and London. By exploring South Africa its influence seeps into their musical collaboration."}, {"wrapperType": "track", "kind": "feature-movie", "trackId": 1478806973, "artistName": "Michael Robison", "trackName": "A Shoe Addict's Christmas", "trackCensoredName": "A Shoe Addict's Christmas", "trackViewUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/a-shoe-addicts-christmas/id1478806973?uo=4", "previewUrl": "https://video-ssl.itunes.apple.com/itunes-assets/Video113/v4/58/00/29/580029fd-d920-c888-a0c8-9307d86aa72d/mzvf_8679729862519002424.640x478.h264lc.U.p.m4v", "artworkUrl30": "https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video113/v4/d3/24/fd/d324fdda-a624-a8e3-39a4-74a146102fd7/pr_source.png/30x30bb.jpg", "artworkUrl60": "https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video113/v4/d3/24/fd/d324fdda-a624-a8e3-39a4-74a146102fd7/pr_source.png/60x60bb.jpg", "artworkUrl100": "https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video113/v4/d3/24/fd/d324fdda-a624-a8e3-39a4-74a146102fd7/pr_source.png/100x100bb.jpg", "collectionPrice": 7.99, "trackPrice": 7.99, "collectionHdPrice": 9.99, "trackHdPrice": 9.99, "releaseDate": "2019-10-29T07:00:00Z", "collectionExplicitness": "notExplicit", "trackExplicitness": "notExplicit", "trackTimeMillis": 5160063, "country": "USA", "currency": "USD", "primaryGenreName": "Holiday", "contentAdvisoryRating": "NR", "shortDescription": "A Hallmark Channel original movie.

Then we speak with leading journalists from Arab television news to discover what their experience with President Obama and his administration is like.Is their experience particular and peculiar? Empire moves on, to talk to members of the foreign press from Europe, India, Russia, Australia, and China. It is astonishing that Obama, who came into office promising a new era of openness and transparency, is now being called the worst president for the press in modern times, prosecuting both journalists and whistleblowers in record numbers.Empire sits down with James Risen, the most important investigative reporter that the NY Times has, who could be facing prison, to find out what it is like to be an American reporter in times like these.The reality is, that it is a struggle from both sides, the journalists knocking at the gates, and the people inside charged with managing the message and defending the realm.
